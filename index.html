             <p>LandingPage module provide Theme filed inside LandingPage content type. You can have themes and templates from scratch and another design for your landing page without inheriting of the existing styles of your default theme and stupid overwriting CSS properties.
You can set for each paragraph view mode a separate template (take a look in /themes/landingpage_bootstrap/templates/paragraph--landingpage-*.html.twig)
also there is an ability to add inline styles for each paragraph that, of course, not the best option, but provide extremely high and unlimited customization abilities in admin area.
for each paragraph you can set several classes and support them in your LandingPage theme, I'm not sure that Classy Paragraph approach does'n do the same. But as I remember my experience with that module it allow to customize one class only for each paragraph. </p>
